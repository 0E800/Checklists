# Introduction
Even though that a penetration test is a creative process most people maintain a private checklists to ensure that they will not forget to test various scenarios and maintain the overall quality of the assessment.

# Purpose
The idea is to create detailed checklists that can be used by penetration testers during their assessments. Every checklist will be linked with a detailed blog post on https://pentestlab.blog which it will describe the technique and how to perform the required task. Information will also be included in the Wiki page on Github.
